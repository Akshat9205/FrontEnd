  <h1>Typography and Text Styling Demonstration</h1>

  <article>
    <p>
      <strong>Typography</strong> plays a vital role in how information is perceived and read. 
      Choosing the right <em>font family</em> and size improves readability and visual harmony.
      <mark>Consistent spacing</mark> and alignment can transform simple text into engaging content.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal of typography is not only to make text legible but also to create a feeling. 
      Whether you use a modern sans-serif or a classic serif, font choice influences mood and tone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Good design relies on balance — between font weights, spacing, and contrast. 
      Experiment with <em>line-height</em> and <mark>letter-spacing</mark> for a polished look.
